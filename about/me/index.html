<p>I am a computer programmer by training who is currently working as a project manager for a range of small to large applications, most of which are web based.</p>
<p>I am also a gaming enthusist.  Most peole hear that and think video games, and while I do enjoy some video games I am more interested in tabletop games.  In addition to just playing them I also volunteer my time with an organization who promotes the use of tabletop gaming for educational and theraputic purposes, <a href="https://www.thebodhanagroup.org/">The Bodhana Group</a>.  Personally gaming has helped me to overcome my social anxiety.  I met my wife because of tabletop gaming, and it has been a way to bond with my children.</p>
<p>I am also a member of the Filizzi Family (it would be pretty weird to create a website dedicated to them if I wasn&rsquo;t).</p>
<p>I am Matt Filizzi</p>
