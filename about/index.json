I am a computer programmer by training who is currently working as a project manager for a range of small to large applications, most of which are web based.\nI am also a gaming enthusist. Most peole hear that and think video games, and while I do enjoy some video games I am more interested in tabletop games. In addition to just playing them I also volunteer my time with an organization who promotes the use of tabletop gaming for educational and theraputic purposes, The Bodhana Group. Personally gaming has helped me to overcome my social anxiety. I met my wife because of tabletop gaming, and it has been a way to bond with my children.\nI am also a member of the Filizzi Family (it would be pretty weird to create a website dedicated to them if I wasn\u0026rsquo;t).\nI am Matt Filizzi\n"
