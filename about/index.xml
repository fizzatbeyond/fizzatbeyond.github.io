      <description>Who Am I? I am a computer programmer by training who is currently working as a project manager for a range of small to large applications, most of which are web based.
I am also a gaming enthusist. Most peole hear that and think video games, and while I do enjoy some video games I am more interested in tabletop games. In addition to just playing them I also volunteer my time with an organization who promotes the use of tabletop gaming for educational and theraputic purposes, The Bodhana Group.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Filizzi Family.
Filizzi is a mis-spelled last name from the Tollo region of Italy. The best I can tell is that when my Great-Great Grandfather came to the US his last name was mis-spelled.
As I do more genology research I will update this page with more detailed information.</description>
