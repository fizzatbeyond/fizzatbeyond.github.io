      <h1 id="meditation">Meditation</h1>
<p>I am an avid meditator.  I first started about 15 years ago when I was attending
the local UU church.  Initially it was very infrequent, maybe once a month.  I
eventually started attending <a href="http://bmls.org">Blue Mountin Lotus Society</a>, at
first every other week.  Sarah could tell the difference in my personality when
I hadn&rsquo;t gone in a while.</p>
<p>Then Covid happened.  Everywhere shut down.  I was unable to continue going to
my regular weekly meditations.  I tried do do it by muself at home, but I wasn&rsquo;t
anywhere near consistant.  I tried to find online meditations but was having
trouble finding anything that I liked.  I was starting to be in a real bad way.</p>
<p>Eventually other buddhist meditations started up again, but not BMLS.  They were
only doing online meditations and it just wasn&rsquo;t working for me.  So I decided
to try some of the other options.  None of them felt right.  I continued looking
online for other meditation practices.  Eventually I cam across
<a href="http://jasonquinnzen.com">Jason Quinn</a> and
his wonderful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JasonQuinnZen">youtube channel</a>.  This
ended up being exactly what I needed. Eventually BMLS started up again, so I was
regularly doing meditation twice a week.</p>
<p>I decided that I was going to do a daily practice, it has been 25 days since I
started that.  I can feel changes in my general mood and in the way I percieve
things around me.  One thing I hadn&rsquo;t expected, and may not be related is that
I am starting to remember dreams.  I have rarely ever remembered any pieces
of dreams, but the last 3 days I have woken up and remembered what I was dreaming
about.</p>
