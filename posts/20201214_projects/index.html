      <p>I&rsquo;ve decided I&rsquo;m going to detail out what I&rsquo;m playing with these days.  Not just technology but things in general.</p>
<h1 id="programming">Programming</h1>
<h3 id="ruby">Ruby</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m re-teaching myself Ruby.  But not for Rails.  I find the language very elegant, and wish I had kept up to date with the development of the language but life happens.  Now I&rsquo;m back to a place where I feel comfortable re-teaching myself some of the programming languages that I used to use.</p>
<h1 id="linux">Linux</h1>
<h3 id="manjaro">Manjaro</h3>
<p>So For the longest time I was a debian user (second distrobution that I installed way back in <em>1997</em>), and while I&rsquo;ve tried other distributions over the years, but mostly just forks off of debian (and later ubuntu forks) I have usually come back to debian.  However I have been unhappy with debian lately due to development speed.  So I have been test driving Manjaro for a few weeks and am pleased with it.  Time will tell if it is going to replace debian as my distro of choice.</p>
<h3 id="ubuntu">Ubuntu</h3>
<p>While I am using Manjaro as my distro of choice these days, I am still using a debian based oss (ubuntu) on my Raspberry Pi for numerous in-home projects.  At some point I might migrate it over to Manjaro but for now I am happy to have a mixture of two different environments.</p>
<h1 id="games">Games</h1>
<h3 id="rpgs">RPGs</h3>
<p>While I am playing in two different D&amp;D campaigns virtually, I am missing in-person game play.  I have collected some items to build dungeon tiles using the method of <a href="https://blackmagiccraft.wordpress.com/">Black Magic Craft</a>.  I need to buy some more tools but I plan on making numerous tiles and map props for gameplay when we can be around the table again.  And if I have any skills with it, I plan on making a set of tiles to donate to <a href="https://www.thebodhanagroup.org/">Bodhana</a> for auction at the next Save Against FEar.</p>
<p>I am also interested in trying to create my own game, but not D&amp;D.  I have been researching other systems trying to find one that I like for the story I want to tell.  I am looking for a modern world with super powered individuals.  While I know this can be done with things like <a href="https://fate-srd.com/">FATE</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutants_%26_Masterminds">Mutants and Materminds</a>, neither of those <em>feel</em> right to me.  So more investigation is requried.</p>
<h1 id="other">Other</h1>
<h3 id="video-editing">Video Editing</h3>
<p>I am not sure why, but I have been wanting to get into video editing lately.  I am thinking that I will document some of my other projects for posting on YouTube and then I can play around with video editing.  Seems like a resonable idea to me.</p>
<h3 id="podcasting">Podcasting</h3>
<p>I really do want to try this too, but I can&rsquo;t convince myself to step up and try it.  Probably just fear of rejection.  It doesn&rsquo;t matter if no one listens, just like it doesn&rsquo;t matter if no one atually ends up reading what I&rsquo;m writing right now.  It is the process of creation that is important to me.</p>
<h3 id="disc-golf">Disc Golf</h3>
<p>Yeah I know, this feels like the odd ball in all of this.  I need to get more exercize and I have enjoyed doing this (as long as I don&rsquo;t loose too many discs).  So when the weather warms up again, I plan on trying my hand at this again.</p>
