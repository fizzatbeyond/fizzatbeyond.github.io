      <p>Over the past few weeks, and over the next few weeks a lot of changes have happened (and will happen) to the animals in our home.</p>
<p>Starting with the sad news, our older cat <strong>Maisy</strong> starting having litter box issues.  After taking her to the vet we discovered advanced kidney disease.  The vet first perscribed a medicine for that along with special food.  This helped however she started vomitting all over the place, almost more than she was eating.  They then perscribed two other medicines to help, however they caused her to stop eating all together.  In addition to all this, while she was never a large cat, her weight has dropped into alarming teritory.  They think in addition to kidney disease she also has some sort of bowel cancer.  We were trying to just make her comfortable until we say our final good byes next week.</p>
<p>The happier news is the new puppy <strong>Rorschach</strong>.  While it may seem like we are replacing a dying animal with a new one, that really isn&rsquo;t the case.  We had been talking about bringing a new puppy into the house since COVID started because we are home all the time and it would be easier to train a new dog in that kind of situation.  We finally decided to do just that.</p>
