<p>So I had a procedure scheduled for last Monday.  What was the procedure I hear nobody asking.  Well it was exactly the one that the Oncologist thought I would need, sclerotherapy.  The only difference from what was originally thought was that the issue wasn&rsquo;t an <strong>intramuscular hemangioma</strong>, it was a vascular malformation that causes blood to pool and cause me pain.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-now">So what now</h2>
<p>Well now that the procedure has been done, I am in recovery.  Per the doctor, it should take about two weeks to recover, which is where I am now.  The pain level has been growing for the past week but based on the way I am feeling as I write this I would venture a guess that it has peaked and maybe started to decline.</p>
<p>In two months post procedure they want me to come back in for an MRI to see if they got all of it.  If they did then we&rsquo;re golden, if not then probably a second round at some point.</p>
<p>Either way here&rsquo;s hoping that I get relief.  It only took about 40 years to get here so I am hopeful.</p>
