<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Ok so That&rsquo;s a bit of a vague statement.  Really I&rsquo;ve had a hip problem when I was a child.  When I was 8, I believe, my parents saw me limping around and took me to the doctor.  They did X-Rays and found calcium deposits in my left hip.  Other than the X-Rays every year or so they did nothing.  By age 12 they were gone.  Over the years my hip has always been an issue, if I sit too much or on an uncomfortable seat my hip will scream at me.  I&rsquo;ve done Physical Therapy numerous times with no real relief</p>
<h3 id="whats-going-on-now">What&rsquo;s going on now</h3>
<p>So my hip pain has been spiking again lately, which means that it was time once again for a round of PT.  The last round was in 2019 so they&rsquo;ve been getting more frequent.  This time however I&rsquo;ve had pain in a different location.  It used to be only on the outside of my hip, now however it&rsquo;s also been in more of the crotch area, going down my leg with a burning feeling.</p>
<p>Back in February I was back at the doctor to have it looked at.  They did X-Rays and prescribed more PT.  The X-Rays however showed that the hip was impinging the nerve, hence the new pain.  The plan was to do PT to appease insurance then do an MRI of the hip to get a good look at what is really going on.  Two weeks ago I had the MRI, and have had the technician&rsquo;s notes on and I&rsquo;ve been a bit freaked out by them since.  Today however is the follow-up with the doctor.</p>
<h3 id="follow-up">Follow-up</h3>
<p>The MRI report said something about a mass in my hip and want me to come back for a second MRI, this time with contrast to make sure that it isn&rsquo;t something bad, even though it is unlikely that it would be.  Assuming that it is not, it&rsquo;ll be more rounds of PT and injections.  Some day someone will have an idea of what is going on in my hip.</p>
