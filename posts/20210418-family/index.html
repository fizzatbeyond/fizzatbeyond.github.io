      <h1 id="family">Family</h1>
<p>So I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about family for the last few weeks.  Maybe it&rsquo;s because my wife gave me a DNA test for my birthday and I&rsquo;m waiting on the results.  Maybe it&rsquo;s fact that I&rsquo;ve never been close with my extended family due to falling outs my parents had when my brother and I were young.  Maybe it&rsquo;s because my oldest son just turned 16.  Or maybe it&rsquo;s becaus COVID has kept me sepearted from almost everyone I consider family.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who, <strong><em>if anyone</em></strong>, will actually read this but at least I can put my thoughts down.  I don&rsquo;t know what led to my parents falling out with their families, all I know is that when each of my grandmothers passed away we stopped visiting most of them.  In the time since I became an adult I have done my best to reach out and try to connect with them but it has been difficult.  It&rsquo;s like trying to become friends with someone who you have nothing in common with.  Normally with families you have the shared history but that is missing for me.</p>
<p>With my Dad&rsquo;s medical condition I have a hard time connecting to him, he&rsquo;s not the same person that I remember from my childhood.  My brother, who takes care of Dad, has always been happy living in his own little bubble  of a world.  If it doesn&rsquo;t take place in a book it doesn&rsquo;t hold much interest for him.</p>
<p>When I was a teenager hanging out with my friends I remember making a comment about how they were like family to me, the family that I got to choose.  That is still true to this day.  Yes some of them have left and others have come but since I don&rsquo;t have much of a connection with my biological family I do my best to keep the connections strong with them.</p>
<p>These days I have my own family.  A wonderful wife, two amazing sons, and in-laws who are happy to have me as part of their family.  I even have an ex-wife and her husband who I consider friends, and in some ways extended family.  I do my best to model what a healthy relationship is with friends and family for my boys because I am honestly afraid that if I don&rsquo;t they will grow apart from me like I feel happened to me and my parents, and my parents and their parents.  I want to stop this cycle before it gets too far.</p>
