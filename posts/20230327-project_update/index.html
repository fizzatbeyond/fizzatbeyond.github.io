  <meta name="twitter:description" content="A while ago I decided I wanted a mechanical keyboard. Specifically I wanted a proper ergonomic keyboard. So I did a bunch of research on various types/models. I’m not afraid of soldering so I could do one completely by hand if I wanted.
There are a LOT of mechanical keyboard options out there, but once you start looking at ergonomic ones, the options shrink. Most of what I had found were “Alice” and “Dactyl” based ones. I wanted something a bit more normal than a Dactyl and a bit more ergonomic than an Alice. I ended up deciding on a Mechwild Mokulua. Except for a soldering issue that I managed to lift a few circuits off of the right half of the board it really was easy to build. I did have to customize the key layout a bit because they didn’t prioritize some keys tha I use regularly, but that was easy enough to do and all my changes are publicly available if anyone wanted it. I’d recommend it to anyone who wants to make one.">
