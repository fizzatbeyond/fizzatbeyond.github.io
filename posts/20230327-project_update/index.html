There are a LOT of mechanical keyboard options out there, but once you start looking at ergonomic ones, the options shrink. Most of what I had found were &ldquo;Alice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dactyl&rdquo; based ones.">

      <p>A while ago I decided I wanted a mechanical keyboard.  Specifically I wanted a proper ergonomic keyboard.  So I did a bunch of research on various types/models.  I&rsquo;m not afraid of soldering so I could do one completely by hand if I wanted.</p>
<p>There are a LOT of mechanical keyboard options out there, but once you start looking at ergonomic ones, the options shrink.  Most of what I had found were &ldquo;<a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q8-alice-layout-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard">Alice</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="https://www.diykeyboards.com/keyboards/keyboard-kits/product/dactyl-manuform-kit">Dactyl</a>&rdquo; based ones.  I wanted something a bit more normal than a Dactyl and a bit more ergonomic than an Alice.  I ended up deciding on a <a href="https://mechwild.com/product/mokulua/">Mechwild Mokulua</a>.  Except for a soldering issue that I managed to lift a few circuits off of the right half of the board it really was easy to build.  I did have to customize the key layout a bit because they didn&rsquo;t prioritize some keys tha I use regularly, but that was easy enough to do and all my changes are publicly <a href="https://gitlab.com/mfilizzi/qmk_firmware">available</a> if anyone wanted it.  I&rsquo;d recommend it to anyone who wants to make one.</p>
