<p>I haven&rsquo;t written anything in a long time about my hip story so it&rsquo;s time to document some more.  Since the last post the doctors did a needle biopsy of the hip and everything came back as normal blood and muscle.  This was in line with the belief that my hip issue is caused by an Intramuscular Hemangioma.  After that they preformed an Angiogram with the intent to close the blood vessels that are feeding it (the Sclerotherapy from the last post).  However when they preformed that, it was determinied that it is not a hemangioma.</p>
<h1 id="so-whats-next">So what&rsquo;s next?</h1>
<p>Well after that I had another MRI which determined that the mass has grown.  Not significantly, it could just be due to different people measuring it.  Next week they will be preforming an Open Biopsy to try and get eyes on the mass and figure out what it is.  I am nervous about this whole thing.  The tests proving it wasn&rsquo;t what the expert thought it was and not having any other ideas scares me.  I know that the first test said it wasn&rsquo;t cancer but what if they were just in the wrong spot and somehow missed it?</p>
