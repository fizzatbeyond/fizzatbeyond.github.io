      <description>Family So I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about family for the last few weeks. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because my wife gave me a DNA test for my birthday and I&amp;rsquo;m waiting on the results. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve never been close with my extended family due to falling outs my parents had when my brother and I were young. Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s because my oldest son just turned 16. Or maybe it&amp;rsquo;s becaus COVID has kept me sepearted from almost everyone I consider family.</description>

      <description>Over the past few weeks, and over the next few weeks a lot of changes have happened (and will happen) to the animals in our home.
Starting with the sad news, our older cat Maisy starting having litter box issues. After taking her to the vet we discovered advanced kidney disease. The vet first perscribed a medicine for that along with special food. This helped however she started vomitting all over the place, almost more than she was eating.</description>

      <description>Linux Desktops Over the years I have used a wide variety of Linux desktops. Some for a (very) short period of time, others for years at a time. I&amp;rsquo;ve come to classify them into two categories. The first one would be ones that replicate the user experience of another operating system such as Microsoft Windows or Mac OS. The other classification would be ones that are willing to try something new.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I&amp;rsquo;m going to detail out what I&amp;rsquo;m playing with these days. Not just technology but things in general.
Programming Ruby I&amp;rsquo;m re-teaching myself Ruby. But not for Rails. I find the language very elegant, and wish I had kept up to date with the development of the language but life happens. Now I&amp;rsquo;m back to a place where I feel comfortable re-teaching myself some of the programming languages that I used to use.</description>
