<meta property="og:description" content="So another hip update This one happened about a week ago, I just haven&rsquo;t gotten around to posting it. Last week I had an appointment with an Orthopedic Oncologist. It is a good news/bad news situation. Good news is that it is something she has seen before, an Intramuscular Hemangioma. Which isn&rsquo;t cancerous. The bad news is treatment isn&rsquo;t all that successful.
So what is treatment? Well it&rsquo;s something called Sclerotherapy." />

<p>This one happened about a week ago, I just haven&rsquo;t gotten around to posting it.  Last week I had an appointment with an Orthopedic Oncologist.  It is a good news/bad news situation.  Good news is that it is something she has seen before, an Intramuscular Hemangioma.  Which isn&rsquo;t cancerous.  The bad news is treatment isn&rsquo;t all that successful.</p>
<p>So what is treatment?  Well it&rsquo;s something called <a href="https://www.upmc.com/services/south-central-pa/heart-vascular/vascular/vein-center/treatments-services/sclerotherapy?utm_mrid=mrid2319&amp;utm_source=GOOGLE&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=71700000083218625&amp;utm_adgroup=58700007070499999&amp;utm_term=sclerotherapy&amp;utm_advertiserid=700000002154619&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Sclerotherapy</a>.  If that doesn&rsquo;t solve it we can do surgery to remove the mass however because it is so ill defined there is no guarantee that it&rsquo;ll all be removed and not come back.</p>
