<p>I had previously mentioned that my wife bought me DNA test for my birthday.  While I had to wait a while to get the results, I have them now and have actually had them for about a month.  This gave me some time to think about my results a bit before posting anything.</p>

<p>The results are not quite what I expected.  While I knew a majority of my ancestry came from Germany, hard to be from central PA and that not be the case, I did not expect that Italian would be so low down the list.</p>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know of any family history that points us to England/France/Scotland or Cyprus but that is where my ancestors came from apparently. I consider those minor surprises since it is all Europe, and people traveled around that area.  It is nice to not see any major surprises that don&rsquo;t mesh with what I know of my family history.</p>
