<p>When I was young I loved looking up at the stars to try to spot constilations.  I wasn&rsquo;t very good at it but I could usually find the Big Bipper and Orion, season permitting, among all the other points of light in the sky.  In college I knew people who would go lay out in the field nearby to watch the meteor showers.  It was something magical.</p>
<p>When my wife and I went on our honneymoon, we went on a cruise.  I knew that light polution existed but I didn&rsquo;t realize truely how many stars there are in the night sky.  The light polution has gotten so bad these days that when I go outside and look up, I get excited if I see even half a dozen stars.  We are robbing our children, and ourselves, of the wonders of the cosmos with all our man made lights and it saddens me.</p>
