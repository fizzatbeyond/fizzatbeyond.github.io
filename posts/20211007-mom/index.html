<p>Today would have been my mom&rsquo;s birthday, I believe her 67th one, but I am not sure about that.  She passed away twelve years ago next month.  Sometimes I still think about her and miss her but it has been a long time and a lot has happened.  I am sure that my youngest son has no memory of her, and my oldest would have been 4 when she passed so I don&rsquo;t think he remembers her either.</p>
<p>So I guess all I wanted to say was <strong><em>Happy Birthday Mom</em>, I still miss you even if I don&rsquo;t think about you all that often anymore.</strong></p>
