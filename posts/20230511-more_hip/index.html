<p>So I ended up having another MRI on my hip a week ago.  This time with contrast.  What they saw was a mass in my hip about 4 inches by 2.5 inches by almost an inch.</p>
<p>The notes from the MRI where vaguely worded and gave both myself and my wife a panic, but after talking with the orthopedist it seems less to be worried about (most likely not cancer, and no concern of deteriorating ball joints).</p>
<p>Because of the unknown mass they scheduled a CT scan for my hip, that&rsquo;ll be next week and are referring me to an oncologist.  The orthopedic oncologist is not because of a concern of cancer, but because they are better at removing masses from muscles.</p>
<p>There is still the possibility of it being cancer but it is highly unlikely. So I&rsquo;ll know more once I have the CT scan and the follow-up with the oncologist.</p>
<p>Fun times ahead.</p>
