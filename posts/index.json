        "body": "I have a Hip Problem Background Ok so That\u0026rsquo;s a bit of a vague statement. Really I\u0026rsquo;ve had a hip problem when I was a child. When I was 8, I believe, my parents saw me limping around and took me to the doctor. They did X-Rays and found calcium deposits in my left hip. Other than the X-Rays every year or so they did nothing. By age 12 they were gone. Over the years my hip has always been an issue, if I sit too much or on an uncomfortable seat my hip will scream at me. I\u0026rsquo;ve done Physical Therapy numerous times with no real relief\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s going on now So my hip pain has been spiking again lately, which means that it was time once again for a round of PT. The last round was in 2019 so they\u0026rsquo;ve been getting more frequent. This time however I\u0026rsquo;ve had pain in a different location. It used to be only on the outside of my hip, now however it\u0026rsquo;s also been in more of the crotch area, going down my leg with a burning feeling.\nBack in February I was back at the doctor to have it looked at. They did X-Rays and prescribed more PT. The X-Rays however showed that the hip was impinging the nerve, hence the new pain. The plan was to do PT to appease insurance then do an MRI of the hip to get a good look at what is really going on. Two weeks ago I had the MRI, and have had the technician\u0026rsquo;s notes on and I\u0026rsquo;ve been a bit freaked out by them since. Today however is the follow-up with the doctor.\nFollow-up The MRI report said something about a mass in my hip and want me to come back for a second MRI, this time with contrast to make sure that it isn\u0026rsquo;t something bad, even though it is unlikely that it would be. Assuming that it is not, it\u0026rsquo;ll be more rounds of PT and injections. Some day someone will have an idea of what is going on in my hip.\n"

        "body": "A while ago I decided I wanted a mechanical keyboard. Specifically I wanted a proper ergonomic keyboard. So I did a bunch of research on various types/models. I\u0026rsquo;m not afraid of soldering so I could do one completely by hand if I wanted.\nThere are a LOT of mechanical keyboard options out there, but once you start looking at ergonomic ones, the options shrink. Most of what I had found were \u0026ldquo;Alice\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Dactyl\u0026rdquo; based ones. I wanted something a bit more normal than a Dactyl and a bit more ergonomic than an Alice. I ended up deciding on a Mechwild Mokulua. Except for a soldering issue that I managed to lift a few circuits off of the right half of the board it really was easy to build. I did have to customize the key layout a bit because they didn\u0026rsquo;t prioritize some keys tha I use regularly, but that was easy enough to do and all my changes are publicly available if anyone wanted it. I\u0026rsquo;d recommend it to anyone who wants to make one.\n"

        "body": "Meditation I am an avid meditator. I first started about 15 years ago when I was attending the local UU church. Initially it was very infrequent, maybe once a month. I eventually started attending Blue Mountin Lotus Society, at first every other week. Sarah could tell the difference in my personality when I hadn\u0026rsquo;t gone in a while.\nThen Covid happened. Everywhere shut down. I was unable to continue going to my regular weekly meditations. I tried do do it by muself at home, but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t anywhere near consistant. I tried to find online meditations but was having trouble finding anything that I liked. I was starting to be in a real bad way.\nEventually other buddhist meditations started up again, but not BMLS. They were only doing online meditations and it just wasn\u0026rsquo;t working for me. So I decided to try some of the other options. None of them felt right. I continued looking online for other meditation practices. Eventually I cam across Jason Quinn and his wonderful youtube channel. This ended up being exactly what I needed. Eventually BMLS started up again, so I was regularly doing meditation twice a week.\nI decided that I was going to do a daily practice, it has been 25 days since I started that. I can feel changes in my general mood and in the way I percieve things around me. One thing I hadn\u0026rsquo;t expected, and may not be related is that I am starting to remember dreams. I have rarely ever remembered any pieces of dreams, but the last 3 days I have woken up and remembered what I was dreaming about.\n"

He was there for me when we got divorced. He was there for me on those nights when I came home to an otherwise empty house. He was there for me when I started dating again and when I got married to my wonderful wife.\nHe always looks happy, and used to act that way too. This past year he has significantly slowed down. At this point he is on a high dose of pain medication. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to see him in so much pain every day. It has gotten to the point where he has a hard time getting up, especially after the medication has worn off. I have to regularly help him stand up because he can\u0026rsquo;t always do that on his own.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t stand to see him suffer anymore. Today we are saying good bye to him.\nGood bye old friend.\n"

While I never got confirmation, we all assumed that they had his blood pressure under control and that his kidneys were starting to function better.\nTwo days later I received a call from my brother, which was my first red flag since he never calls. I should note that the call was before 9am, which was my second red flag. He was calling to tell me the bad news, he had just spoken to the rehab place and apparently dad had passed away over night, presumably in his sleep.\nThursday Nate came up and spent the night with us. I think it was as much for him to have company as it was for us. Friday we went down to the funeral home to say good bye before he is cremated. I\u0026rsquo;d be lying if I didn\u0026rsquo;t say there was some small hope that it was a mix-up, that it was someone else who was just mistaken for Dad, but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. That was the last time I will ever see him.\nWhile he hasn\u0026rsquo;t bee the father I knew from my childhood for a long time, thanks stroke, he was still my father, and will always be.\nWhen the weather is nicer we will scatter his ashes at the same place we scattered my mom\u0026rsquo;s, so that whatever is left of them will be together forever.\n"

        "body": "Fall On Tuesday February 22nd I received a call from my brother. This is unusual for a number of reasons, the first being that neither he nor my father ever call me. It always ends up being on me to call them to find out what is going on in their lives and update them on everything around here.\nHe was calling to let me know that our dad had fallen \u0026ldquo;a couple of days ago\u0026rdquo;, and that he was still hurting and having a hard time moving around. Apparently it had gotten to the point where my brother decided it was time to force something to happen. An ambulance ended up coming to the house and took dad to the ER. My father was admitted with a cracked rib, high blood pressure and his kidneys are not working optimally.\nA week later he is still in the hospital. Right now they are working on getting his blood pressure under control and kidneys healthier before they send him to rehab to help get some more stability since he hasn\u0026rsquo;t taken care of himself post-stroke.\nThe house When the EMTs removed him from the house, they filled a report with the office of aging. While I have not heard any follow-up on this yet, I know that they were told that when he returns to the house his bedroom has to be moved to the first floor. On Saturday we went down to help my brother work on cleaning things up to start the swap process. The bedrooms were mostly cleaned up, enough at least that they could be swapped if need be with minimal work.\nThe problem however is that I don\u0026rsquo;t know if he can come back to the house. The reason I say that is because the house is in such bad disrepair that I fear that if anything comes of the EMT report that the house could be condemned. I have mixed feelings on that. The first is that I don\u0026rsquo;t want them to be homeless, but I also feel like they are living in squalor and I don\u0026rsquo;t want that for them.\nI wish they had learned from the last time they let their home get like this. As far as I know this is the third time it\u0026rsquo;s gotten to a state like this, however I believe this time is the worst. I want to help them, but I know deep down that I can only do so much, and that until they take the time to seriously address the root cause of why they let things get like this, anything I do only enables them.\n"

I wasn\u0026rsquo;t very good at it but I could usually find the Big Bipper and Orion, season permitting, among all the other points of light in the sky. In college I knew people who would go lay out in the field nearby to watch the meteor showers. It was something magical.\nWhen my wife and I went on our honneymoon, we went on a cruise. I knew that light polution existed but I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize truely how many stars there are in the night sky. The light polution has gotten so bad these days that when I go outside and look up, I get excited if I see even half a dozen stars. We are robbing our children, and ourselves, of the wonders of the cosmos with all our man made lights and it saddens me.\n"

While I knew a majority of my ancestry came from Germany, hard to be from central PA and that not be the case, I did not expect that Italian would be so low down the list.\nI honestly don\u0026rsquo;t know of any family history that points us to England/France/Scotland or Cyprus but that is where my ancestors came from apparently. I consider those minor surprises since it is all Europe, and people traveled around that area.

        "body": "Family So I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about family for the last few weeks. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because my wife gave me a DNA test for my birthday and I\u0026rsquo;m waiting on the results. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s fact that I\u0026rsquo;ve never been close with my extended family due to falling outs my parents had when my brother and I were young. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because my oldest son just turned 16. Or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s becaus COVID has kept me sepearted from almost everyone I consider family.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t know who, if anyone, will actually read this but at least I can put my thoughts down. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what led to my parents falling out with their families, all I know is that when each of my grandmothers passed away we stopped visiting most of them. In the time since I became an adult I have done my best to reach out and try to connect with them but it has been difficult. It\u0026rsquo;s like trying to become friends with someone who you have nothing in common with. Normally with families you have the shared history but that is missing for me.\nWith my Dad\u0026rsquo;s medical condition I have a hard time connecting to him, he\u0026rsquo;s not the same person that I remember from my childhood. My brother, who takes care of Dad, has always been happy living in his own little bubble of a world. If it doesn\u0026rsquo;t take place in a book it doesn\u0026rsquo;t hold much interest for him.\nWhen I was a teenager hanging out with my friends I remember making a comment about how they were like family to me, the family that I got to choose. That is still true to this day. Yes some of them have left and others have come but since I don\u0026rsquo;t have much of a connection with my biological family I do my best to keep the connections strong with them.\nThese days I have my own family. A wonderful wife, two amazing sons, and in-laws who are happy to have me as part of their family. I even have an ex-wife and her husband who I consider friends, and in some ways extended family. I do my best to model what a healthy relationship is with friends and family for my boys because I am honestly afraid that if I don\u0026rsquo;t they will grow apart from me like I feel happened to me and my parents, and my parents and their parents. I want to stop this cycle before it gets too far.\n"

After taking her to the vet we discovered advanced kidney disease. The vet first perscribed a medicine for that along with special food. This helped however she started vomitting all over the place, almost more than she was eating. They then perscribed two other medicines to help, however they caused her to stop eating all together. In addition to all this, while she was never a large cat, her weight has dropped into alarming teritory. They think in addition to kidney disease she also has some sort of bowel cancer. We were trying to just make her comfortable until we say our final good byes next week.\nThe happier news is the new puppy Rorschach. While it may seem like we are replacing a dying animal with a new one, that really isn\u0026rsquo;t the case. We had been talking about bringing a new puppy into the house since COVID started because we are home all the time and it would be easier to train a new dog in that kind of situation.

        "date" : "2021.02.14",
        "body": "Linux Desktops Over the years I have used a wide variety of Linux desktops. Some for a (very) short period of time, others for years at a time. I\u0026rsquo;ve come to classify them into two categories. The first one would be ones that replicate the user experience of another operating system such as Microsoft Windows or Mac OS. The other classification would be ones that are willing to try something new.\nThere are benefits to both ways of doing things. I would like to layout what I think is the positives and negatives for both design choices.\nReplicate the User Experience The way I see it, the main benefit of taking an existing interface, Windows 10 for example, and replicating it is one of familiarity. New users will see it and just say \u0026ldquo;oh I know what to do, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this before\u0026rdquo;. This allows bringing more people to the community.\nIn order to get them to stay though there needs to be an immediate benefit to them. Linux historically claimed that the benefit was increased security and stability, and while those can both be true, that isn\u0026rsquo;t something that is going to keep users. Extensibility, with ease, is what I see as the way to keep those users. There needs to be features available to them right off the bat that were not present in whatever operating system they are coming from.\nMost popular Linux desktops fall into this category. From KDE and Cinnamon with their very Windows look and feel to Pantheon and Deepin with their MacOS inspired environments. There are plenty of users who love these environments and they are great, I myself used KDE for many years, only leaving when they transitioned to KDE4 because I didn\u0026rsquo;t feel that it was very flushed out at the time, it got better.\nTry Something New This is a much harder category, both in design and keeping users. It can be very rewarding when it is done properly. I want to highlight two environments here.\nThe first one has been around for a long time and during that time has, in my opinion, not been afraid to experiment with their design. Enlightenment always felt to me like the desktop I wanted to use if I wanted to show off how different Linux was from everything else. In terms of usage by the Linux population as a whole, it has never really caught on but I am glad they are still around trying new ideas.\nThe second one I want to highlight here has also been around a long time however in terms of \u0026ldquo;trying something new\u0026rdquo; is really a more recent shift. Gnome went from being a more standard (Windows like) desktop to a complete redesign when they released version 3. In those early days a lot of users were unhappy with the change in direction, causing several desktops to be forked off of the previous version such as Mate and Cinnamon as well as other desktop design directions such as Unity, which has since been killed off and more or less turned into a plugin for Gnome. Gnome has become the main desktop environment for a large portion of the Linux world. Because of this I feel that it is one of the crown jewels of the open source world.\nGnome is preparing to release their next version (3.40) which changes the workflow again. While this one is not as revolutionary as their move to 3, it is causing a lot of community stir. I will admit, I am leery of the new design changes, however I know that is because change is hard for people to accept, myself included. With all that said, I do very much look forward to trying it out and getting to know the new look and feel that will most likely be my daily driver.\n-Matt\n"

Not just technology but things in general.\nProgramming Ruby I\u0026rsquo;m re-teaching myself Ruby. But not for Rails. I find the language very elegant, and wish I had kept up to date with the development of the language but life happens. Now I\u0026rsquo;m back to a place where I feel comfortable re-teaching myself some of the programming languages that I used to use.\nLinux Manjaro So For the longest time I was a debian user (second distrobution that I installed way back in 1997), and while I\u0026rsquo;ve tried other distributions over the years, but mostly just forks off of debian (and later ubuntu forks) I have usually come back to debian. However I have been unhappy with debian lately due to development speed. So I have been test driving Manjaro for a few weeks and am pleased with it. Time will tell if it is going to replace debian as my distro of choice.\nUbuntu While I am using Manjaro as my distro of choice these days, I am still using a debian based oss (ubuntu) on my Raspberry Pi for numerous in-home projects. At some point I might migrate it over to Manjaro but for now I am happy to have a mixture of two different environments.\nGames RPGs While I am playing in two different D\u0026amp;D campaigns virtually, I am missing in-person game play. I have collected some items to build dungeon tiles using the method of Black Magic Craft. I need to buy some more tools but I plan on making numerous tiles and map props for gameplay when we can be around the table again. And if I have any skills with it, I plan on making a set of tiles to donate to Bodhana for auction at the next Save Against FEar.\nI am also interested in trying to create my own game, but not D\u0026amp;D. I have been researching other systems trying to find one that I like for the story I want to tell. I am looking for a modern world with super powered individuals. While I know this can be done with things like FATE and Mutants and Materminds, neither of those feel right to me. So more investigation is requried.\nOther Video Editing I am not sure why, but I have been wanting to get into video editing lately. I am thinking that I will document some of my other projects for posting on YouTube and then I can play around with video editing. Seems like a resonable idea to me.\nPodcasting I really do want to try this too, but I can\u0026rsquo;t convince myself to step up and try it. Probably just fear of rejection. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if no one listens, just like it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter if no one atually ends up reading what I\u0026rsquo;m writing right now. It is the process of creation that is important to me.\nDisc Golf Yeah I know, this feels like the odd ball in all of this. I need to get more exercize and I have enjoyed doing this (as long as I don\u0026rsquo;t loose too many discs). So when the weather warms up again, I plan on trying my hand at this again.\n-Matt\n"
