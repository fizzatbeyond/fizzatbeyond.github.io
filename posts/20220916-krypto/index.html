<p>He has been with me through thick and thin.  My ex and I got him when he was somewhere between 8 and 10 weeks old.  That was over 12 years ago.  He was there for me when we got divorced.  He was there for me on those nights when I came home to an otherwise empty house.  He was there for me when I started dating again and when I got married to my wonderful wife.</p>
<p>He always looks happy, and used to act that way too. This past year he has significantly slowed down.  At this point he is on a high dose of pain medication.  It&rsquo;s hard to see him in so much pain every day.  It has gotten to the point where he has a hard time getting up, especially after the medication has worn off.  I have to regularly help him stand up because he can&rsquo;t always do that on his own.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stand to see him suffer anymore.  Today we are saying good bye to him.</p>
<p>Good bye old friend.</p>
