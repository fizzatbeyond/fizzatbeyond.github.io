      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided I&amp;rsquo;m going to detail out what I&amp;rsquo;m playing with these days. Not just technology but things in general.
Programming Ruby I&amp;rsquo;m re-teaching myself Ruby. But not for Rails. I find the language very elegant, and wish I had kept up to date with the development of the language but life happens. Now I&amp;rsquo;m back to a place where I feel comfortable re-teaching myself some of the programming languages that I used to use.</description>

      <description>Who Am I? I am a computer programmer by training who is currently working as a project manager for a range of small to large applications, most of which are web based.
I am also a gaming enthusist. Most peole hear that and think video games, and while I do enjoy some video games I am more interested in tabletop games. In addition to just playing them I also volunteer my time with an organization who promotes the use of tabletop gaming for educational and theraputic purposes, The Bodhana Group.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Filizzi Family.
Filizzi is a mis-spelled last name from the Tollo region of Italy. The best I can tell is that when my Great-Great Grandfather came to the US his last name was mis-spelled.
As I do more genology research I will update this page with more detailed information.</description>
